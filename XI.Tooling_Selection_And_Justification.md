# Tooling Selection and Justification

---

## 1. Development
These tools form the backbone of the application's architecture, enabling efficient and reliable development.

- **Docker**  
  - **Purpose:** Containerization platform to run and deploy applications consistently across environments.  
  - **Justification:** Ensures reliable, isolated environments for all services, simplifying development and deployment.  
  - **Integration:** Hosts containers for backend (Java, Golang) and database (PostgreSQL), ensuring compatibility across components.  

- **HTML and CSS/SCSS**  
  - **Purpose:** Core web technologies for building and styling the frontend interface.  
  - **Justification:** Enables responsive, visually appealing design tailored to user needs.  
  - **Integration:** Works with React for building structured, consistent UI components across devices.  

- **React**  
  - **Purpose:** JavaScript library for creating interactive, fast, and modular front-end interfaces.  
  - **Justification:** Allows for a dynamic user experience with real-time updates and efficient state management.  
  - **Integration:** Interfaces with backend APIs (Java, Golang) to fetch and display data, enhancing user interaction.  

- **Java**  
  - **Purpose:** Backend programming language for business logic and API services.  
  - **Justification:** Reliable for handling complex transactions, security, and scalability requirements.  
  - **Integration:** Runs in Docker containers, interacts with PostgreSQL for data management, and connects with the front end via APIs.  

- **Golang**  
  - **Purpose:** Language optimized for building efficient, scalable microservices.  
  - **Justification:** Ideal for handling performance-critical services, like real-time data filtering and search.  
  - **Integration:** Works with Java in a microservices architecture, deployed with Docker for consistency and scalability.  

- **PostgreSQL**  
  - **Purpose:** Relational database for storing user data, listings, and transaction history.  
  - **Justification:** Efficiently manages structured data, with advanced indexing for faster queries.  
  - **Integration:** Connects with Java and Golang services, deployed within Docker for seamless data access and management.

## 3. Automation & Testing
These tools ensure quality and stability during development and deployment.

- **Jenkins**  
  - **Purpose:** CI/CD automation server for continuous integration and testing.  
  - **Justification:** Automates testing processes, ensuring stability and quality in code updates.  
  - **Integration:** Connected to GitHub for automated builds and tests on code commits, deployed with Docker for consistent environments.
