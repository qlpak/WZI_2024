AutoLink is an online platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of vehicles. It provides users with a convenient way to browse, list, and transact vehicles, connecting individual buyers, sellers, and automotive dealers in a seamless digital environment. 

The main goal is to create tools that simplify the search process, improve trust between buyers and sellers, and provide valuable insights into vehicle history. Non-goals include integration with third-party services unrelated to vehicle sales, and adding features that go beyond the core purpose of buying and selling vehicles (e.g., financing or insurance modules).

The target audience for this project includes individual car buyers, sellers, and automotive dealers who use the AutoLink platform for vehicle transactions. The rationale for the project is that it will improve the overall reliability and ease of use of the AutoLink platform, directly addressing user feedback and market demand for a better experience in purchasing used vehicles.
